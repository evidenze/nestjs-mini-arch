# Contributing to Mini

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Mini as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/your-username/mini/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/your-username/mini/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini.git
cd mini
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

4. Run linting:
```bash
npm run lint
```

5. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and consistency. Please ensure your code follows the established patterns:

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Write tests for new functionality
- Keep functions focused and small
